Misskey's Translation
=====================

If you find an untranslated part on Misskey:
--------------------------------------------

1. Look for untranslated parts in the misskey's source code.
	- For instance, if you find an untranslated part in: `src/client/app/mobile/views/pages/home.vue`.

2. Replace the untranslated portion with a character string of the form `%i18n:@foo%`.
	- In fact, `foo` should be a word that is appropriate for the situation and is easy to understand in English.
	- For example, if the untranslated portion is the following "タイムライン" you must write: `%i18n:@timeline%`.

3. Open the `locales/ja-JP.yml`, check whether the <strong>file name (path)</strong> found in step 1 exists, if not, create it.
	- Do not put the beginning of the path `src/client/app/` in the locale file.
	- For example, in this case we want to modify untranslated parts of `src/client/app/mobile/views/pages/home.vue`, so the key is `mobile/views/pages/home.vue`.

4. Add the text property using the `foo` keyword below the path that you found or created in step 2. Make sure to type your text in quotation marks. Text should always be inside of quotes.
	-   For example, in this case we add timeline: `timeline: "タイムライン"` to `locales/ja-JP.yml`.

5. And done！
